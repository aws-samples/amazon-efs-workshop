== Summary

This section will demonstrate how parallelism increases achievable IOPS of an EFS file system.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

=== Generate 4KB files using smallfile

NOTE: smallfile is a python-based distributed POSIX workload generator which can be used to quickly measure performance for a variety of metadata-intensive workloads across an entire cluster. It is an excellent tool to test file systems and I use it regularly to measure and demonstrate operation performance of Amazon EFS and Amazon FSx file systems. Learn more about smallfile from Ben England's github repo - link:https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/smallfile[smallfile].

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video before continuing.

. Return to the browser-based SSH connection of the *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 2* instance.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, refresh or reload the current browser tab. If that doesn't resolve the issue, close the browser-based SSH connection window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 2*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. *_Click_* the radio button next to  *EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection)*. Leave the default user name as *ec2-user* and *_click_* *Connect*.
+
. *_Copy_*, *_paste_*, and *_run_* the following command in the browser-based SSH connection window to see how long it takes for smallfile to generate 1024 4KB files on the EFS file system.
+
[source,bash]
----
job_name=$(echo $(uuidgen)| grep -o ".\{6\}$")
prefix=$(echo $(uuidgen)| grep -o ".\{6\}$")
path=/efs/smallfile/${job_name}
sudo mkdir -p ${path}

threads=1
file_size=4
file_count=1024
operation=create
same_dir=Y

sudo python ~/smallfile/smallfile_cli.py \
--operation ${operation} \
--threads ${threads} \
--file-size ${file_size} \
--files ${file_count} \
--same-dir ${same_dir} \
--hash-into-dirs Y \
--prefix ${prefix} \
--dirs-per-dir ${file_count} \
--files-per-dir ${file_count} \

. How many seconds did it take to generate 1024 zero-byte files on the EFS file system?
* The ouput of the script should look similar to this:
+
[source,bash]
----
host = ip-10-0-0-12,thr = 00,elapsed = 11.924979,files = 1024,records = 1024,status = ok
total threads = 1
total files = 1024
total IOPS = 85
total data =     0.004 GiB
100.00% of requested files processed, warning threshold is  70.00
elapsed time =    11.925
files/sec = 85.870172
IOPS = 85.870172
MiB/sec = 0.335430
----
+
. What was the IOPS?
. How many threads were used?
. Were the files generated in the same directory?
* HINT: Look at the value of the variable "--same-dir".
. *_Copy_* the previous smallfile script to your favorite text editor. Experiment with different smallfile parameter settings. Use the table below as a guide. Test with different threads (--threads), file size (--file-size), file count (--file-count) and same directory (--same-dir).
+
[cols="10,5"]
|===
| Parameter | Description

| `--threads`
a| Number of threads.

| `--file-size`
a| File size in KB.

| `--file-count`
a| Number of files per thread. For example, if you want to see how long it takes to generate 1024 files using 16 threads, change the --threads parameter to 16 and the --file-count parameter to 64 (1024รท16=64).

| `--same-dir`
a| Y will generate all files in the same direct - increasing inode contention. N will generate files in different directories, one for each thread - decreasing inode contention.

|===

* What different parameters did you test?
* How did the different parameter options alter the results?
* The following table and graphs show the sample results of a few tests. Look how increasing the number of threads (increasing parallelism) and writing to different subdirectories (decreasing inode contention) impacts the IOPS and duration.
