. Return to the browser-based SSH connection of the *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 1* instance.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, refresh or reload the current browser tab. If that doesn't resolve the issue, close the browser-based SSH connection window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 1*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. *_Click_* the radio button next to  *EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection)*. Leave the default user name as *ec2-user* and *_click_* *Connect*.
+

. Change the mount command to use an encrypted connection by inserting *-o tls*. *_Run_* the following script. Replace the file system ID place holder <file-system-id> with the file system ID you copied in the earlier step.
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo mount -t efs -o tls <file-system-id> /efs

----
+

----
+
. Notice the DNS name of the file system is no longer in the mount output. The file system DNS name is replaced with the IP address of the loopback or localhost. To help identify the DNS name of a file system mounted with an encrypted connection, query the mount.log file and find the last successful mount operation. *_Run_* the following script.
+
[source,bash]
----
grep -E "Successfully mounted.*/efs" /var/log/amazon/efs/mount.log | tail -1

----
+
. The output of the command should look similar to this:
+
