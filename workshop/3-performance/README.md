---

### Step 1.2: Log on to each Linux EC2 instance

- From the Amazon EC2 Console, select the **EFSWorkshop** instance
- Click **Connect**
- Use the connection information to SSH to the instance using your laptop's terminal application
- SSH to all three EC2 instances you created earlier

### Step 1.3: Install linux applications

> Complete the following steps in your SSH session connected to the each EC2 instance

- Run the following commands to install applications on each instance:

```sh
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils parallel tree git fpart
sudo yum install -y --enablerepo=epel nload
git clone https://github.com/bengland2/smallfile.git

```
- Run the following commands to mount the EFS file system on each instance and change permission of the mount point (add a file system id of the file system you created in VPC1:

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/efs
sudo mount -t efs <efs-file-system-id> /mnt/efs
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/efs

```

---
## Section 2
### Compare the network performance of different EC2 instance types accessing EFS

This section will demonstrate that not all Amazon EC2 instance types are created equal and different instance types provide different levels of network performance when accessing EFS.

### 2.1.  SSH into one Amazon EC2 instance

- Start with the t2.micro instance
- Run the command in 2.2. below and wait for it to complete. Continue to watch the outgoing network metric.
- What happened after ~15GB was written?
- Disconnect from that instance and do the same thing for the m4.large instance then the c5.2xlarge instance
- What's the difference between all three instances?
- Can you explain the performance results between the t2.micro instance and the m4.large instance?

### 2.2.  Use dd to write 17 GB of data to EFS from each instance
Run this command against all three instances to create a 17 GiB file on EFS and monitor network traffic and throughput in real-time
```sh
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/efs/17G-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N).img bs=1M count=17408 conv=fsync &
nload -u M

```

### 2.3.  Close the SSH sessions to the t2.micro and m4.large instances


### Results
All EC2 instance types have different network performance characteristics so each can drive different levels of throughput to EFS. While the t2.micro instance initially appears to have better network performance when compared against an m4.large instance, it's high network throughput is short lived as a result of the burst characteristics on t2 instances.

## Section 3

### Results
Not all file transfer utilities are created equal. File systems are distributed across an unconstrained number of storage servers and this distributed data storage design means that multithreaded applications like fpsync, and GNU parallel can be used to drive substantial levels of throughput and IOPS to EFS when compared to single-threaded applications.

___
## Section 5
### Provisioned Throughput mode

The throughput mode of the file system helps determine the overall throughput a file system is able to achieve. You can select the throughput mode at any time (subject to daily limits). Changing the throughput mode is a non-disruptive operation and can be run while clients continuously access the file system.  You can choose between two throughput modes, Bursting or Provisioned.

Provisioned Throughput is available for applications that require a higher throughput to storage ratio than those allowed by Bursting Throughput mode. In this mode you can provision the file system’s throughput independent of the amount of data stored in the file system. This allows you to optimize your file system’s throughput performance to match your application’s needs, and your application can drive up to the provisioned throughput continuously. 
This concept of provisioned performance is similar to features offered by other AWS services like provisioned IOPS for Amazon Elastic Block Store PIOPS (io1) volumes and provisioned throughput with read and write capacity units for Amazon DynamoDB. As with these services, you are billed separately for the performance or throughput you provision and the storage you use, e.g. two billing dimensions. When file systems are running in Provisioned Throughput mode, you are billed for the storage you use in GB-Month and for the throughput provisioned in MB/s-Month. The storage charge, for both Bursting and Provisioned Throughput modes includes the baseline throughput of the file system in the price of storage. This means the price of storage includes 1 MiB/s of throughput per 20 GiB of data stored so you will be billed for the throughput you provision above this limit. 

You can increase Provisioned Throughput as often as you need.  You can decrease Provisioned Throughput or switch throughput modes as long as it’s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change.  


### 5.1.  Change from Bursting to Provisioned Throughput mode

- Run this command on the c5.2xlarge to see how long it will take to create 64 GB of data on an EFS file system using dd. This command will use 32 threads and generate data using a 4 MB block size syncing data and metadata at the end of each 4 MB block.

```sh
time seq 1 32 | parallel --will-cite -j 32 dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/efs/16G-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N)-{} bs=4M count=512 oflag=sync &
nload -u M

```

- While the command is running, switch back to the Amazon EFS Management Console.
- Select the EFS file system you have mounted.
- Click **Actions** > **Manage throughput modes**
- Select **Provisioned** and set the provisioned throughput to 150 MiB/s.
- Click **Save** then quickly switch back to the SSH window show the nload results of your dd command above.
- What happens to the throughput when the file system switches to provisioned throughput?
- What happens if you increase the throughput to 238 MiB/s?
- How long does it take to generate 64 GiB of data?
- Review the CloudWatch dashboard of your file system.

```
- How long did it take to complete?
- Why is there a difference between mounting it using NFSv4.0 vs. NFSv4.1?

## Section 7
### EFS best practices

- Test with General Purpose performance mode
- Start with Bursting throughput mode
- Mount on clients running Linux kernel 4+ (RHEL 3.10+)
- Mount using EFS mount helper (NFSv4.1 client)
- Use large IO size (aggregate your IO)
- Access the file system in parallel using multiple threads
- Access the file system in parallel using multiple instances
- For heavy write workloads, write in mulitple directories in parallel
